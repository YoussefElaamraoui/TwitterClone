# TwitterClone

This repository is for a University assignment, whose goal is to create a Twitter clone.

I opted for a MEVN (MongoDB-Express-Vuejs-Nodejs)  stack app.
My reasons: 

1) having a better understanding of MEVN
2) simplicity

Even though the feature of the app are Twitter-like (threads, posts and comments), I did not replicate the same design, so feel free to download it and give me some feedback.

I hope it will inspire you to create a similar project, have fun!
